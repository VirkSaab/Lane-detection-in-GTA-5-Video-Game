# Road Lane detection in real-time GTA 5 Video Game
This project runs on windows only due to the GTA 5 Game. It includes real-time lane detection while driving a car in the game. It uses Computer Vision on low resolution images obtained by screen grabbing script to detect the color of the lanes and postprocessing like thresholding, dilation, etc. to improve the results. 
Run the Game in a small window for more FPS.
